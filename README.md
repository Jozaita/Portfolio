# Portfolio

I'm Juan Ozaita Corral, welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find a collection of certificates, projects, and tutorials related to my programming experience and academic studies.

_
## Academic Background üìö

- **Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics ([University Carlos III de Madrid](#)**
  - Advisor: [Anxo S√°nchez](#)
  - Research Focus: Exploring the dynamics of human behavior within specific contexts, unveiling the intricate interplay between individuals and groups in response to various stimuli and situations.

- **M.Sc. in Complex Systems Physics ([IFISC, Palma de Mallorca](#))**
  - Delved into Complex Systems Physics, focusing on understanding emergent behavior and modeling opinion dynamics through mathematical and computational approaches.

- **B.Sc. in Physics ([Universidade de Santiago de Compostela](#))**
  - Initiated my academic journey with a Bachelor's degree in Physics, conducting research on periodic forcing in reaction-diffusion systems and contributing to our understanding of nonlinear dynamics.

## Professional Experience üî¨

As of July 2023, I've transitioned from my role as a Research Consultant at the Institute for Futures Studies to become a Postdoctoral Researcher at UC3M. My current specialization lies in Big Data and Internet Data Analysis.

## Technical Skills and Complementary Formation üíªüìä

My academic pursuits have equipped me with a versatile set of technical skills, including proficiency in programming and expertise in areas such as numerical analysis, dynamical systems, agent-based simulations, network analysis, machine learning, data science, and web programming. I write mainly in Python, but also have coded in Java, JavaScript, Fortran and C++. 


## Certificates üéì

Certifications from different institutions or online courses I have obtained, related mainly to programming languages and libraries. 

## Projects üöÄ

Explore my projects related to acculturation, complex systems, ethnic markers, experiments, networks, parkings, and physics thesis in the ["Projects"](Projects/) directory.


### Acculturation

A study of the connection between network attributes and nationality, showing that the cultural differences can be seen and measured in their social network properties. The paper can be checked here: 
  - [PDF](Projects/Acculturation/Cultural_Signature.pdf)
  
  
### Ethnic Markers

A study of the cooperation game including an external symbol, its equilibrium conditions, and the study of the different parameters proposed in the paper by McElreath et al. from a theoretican and experimental view. The papers can be checked here:
  - [Paper model](Projects/ethnic_markers/Ethnic_markers_model.pdf)
  - [Paper experiment](Projects/Ethnic_markers/ethnic_markers_experiment.pdf)
  
Plots and scripts are in subfolders of the mentioned one.
 

### Known by company we keep
A study of the triadic influence in social networks and the importance of topological properties of these structures in order to predict the nature of social bonds, like friendships. The papers can be checked here:
  - [Paper model](Projects/Known_by_company_we_keep/Known_by_company_we_keep.pdf) 
  
Plots and scripts are in subfolders of the mentioned one. A sample program can be found in [sample program](Projects/Known_by_company_we_keep/Scripts_dev/Sample_program.py), while some experimental data in order to test can be found in [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7647000#.Y-5eDtLMJH4). 

### Parkings
A study of a game theory model where reinforcement learning is applied in order to predict an experimental distribution for the competition for parking spots, depending on price. 
  - [Paper](Projects/Parkings/Parkings_paper.pdf)
  
Plots and scripts are in subfolders of the mentioned one: [Scrips_and_plots](Projects/Parkings/Scrips_and_plots).

### Experiments

Explore my experimental data scripts and oTree files in the ["Experiments"](Projects/Experiments/README.md) directory.

#### Data Scripts

- **Ethnic Markers Experiment**
  - Scripts for analyzing ethnic markers experiment data: [ethnic_markers_experiment](Projects/Experiments/Data%20Scripts/ethnic_markers_experiment).

- **LAABS Experiments**
  - Scripts for analyzing data during my stay in Roma (LAABS institute with Giulia Andriguetto): [LAABS_experiments](Projects/Experiments/Data%20Scripts/LAABS_experiments).

#### oTree Files

Explore various oTree files for different experiments, related to different game theory models, like the code for the ethnic markers experiment and other game theory experiments, like the ones realized at the LAABS institute. Check them at [experiments](Projects/Otree_Files)


  
### Complex Systems Master


- **Master Thesis**
  - Related to a known sociophysical project called the voter model. The voter model is a model of opinion dynamics, and in this thesis we analyzed quantitatively the role of a temporal variable called "age" metaphorically. This "age" measures the probability of changing its opinion, and has its own dynamics. It can be checked here: [Noisy Voter Model](Projects/Complex_systems_master/Master%20thesis/noisy_voter_model.pdf)

- **Other exercises**
  - Related to some exercises and recreations of different areas, such as network theory, stochastic simulations, or some use cases of statistical physics. As an example: [Barabasi-Albert_2](Projects/Complex_systems_master/Network_theory/Barabasi-Albert_2.py), [Ising](Projects/Complex_systems_master/Stochastic_simulation/Ising.f90) or [ARCH](Projects/Complex_systems_master/Stochastic_simulation/ARCH.f90).



### Physics Thesis

Related to the work developed in my physics thesis. The thesis treats an small variation to the Belusov-Zhabotinsky reactions, including a periodic forcement, which promotes chaos and creates a transition to chaos that can be checked in the cycles. It can be checked [here](Projects/Physics_thesis/TFG.pdf)


## Tutorials üìñ

Check out tutorials on [Java](tutorials/Java), [JavaScript](tutorials/Javascript), and [Python](tutorials/Python) (my main language) in the ["Tutorials"](tutorials/) directory. Inside each of the tutorials, I include some exercises, or mini-projects that I found interesting.
