					<h4>Instructions II</h4>
					<p>After you and all group members made your decision, by some probability <b>a disaster occurs that may destroy all or part of your earnings</b>. How much you lose as a result of the disaster depends on how much you and your group members contributed  to the collective pot. Every token invested into the collective pot<b> reduces the impact of the disaster by {{d_impact_percentage}}%</b>.</p> 
					<br><br>
					<p>There is<b> a {{dis_prob_percentage|floatformat:"0"}}%  chance that a disaster occurs</b>. In practice that means that at the end of this study, the computer spins a roulette wheel with <b>ten slots</b>: {{comp_dis_prob_number}} green slots and {{dis_prob_number}} red slots. The outcome of the roulette spin determines whether or not a disaster takes place.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If the roulette ends on one of the {{comp_dis_prob_number}} green slots, no disaster occurs.</li>
    <li>If the roulette ends on one of the {{dis_prob_number}} green slots, a disaster occurs.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>To understand how the computer determines whether a disaster takes place, you may spin the <b>roulette wheel</b> below to simulate the outcome of the task. You should spin this wheel for a minimum of 10 times and observe the outcome of this simulated scenario.</p>
