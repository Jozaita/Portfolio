	<p>Welcome to our study and thank you for participating. Before starting we will provide some general information about this study. </p>
	<br><br>
	<b>About the study</b>
	<p>The expected duration of this study is (on average) around <b>25 minutes</b>. In this study you will participate in <b>two modules</b> that each consist of several tasks.</p> 
	<br>
	<p><b>Module 1</b> is an interactive module, where you will be presented with several decision tasks that allow you to earn additional money. How much you earn depends on the decision task, on your choice in this task, and on the choice of other study participants. Note that these are real participants: There is <b>no deception</b> involved in this study. The interaction with these participants is <b>anonymous</b>. You will not know who the other participants are and they will not know who you are. Your choices and how much you earned in these choices will not be communicated to the other participants. <b>Module 2</b> consists of a short survey. After completing both modules, you will be redirected to Prolific. After all participants completed the study, we will transfer your personal payment on Prolific. In total, your payout for this study can vary between <b>£2.50</b> (the standard fee for study completion) and <b>£12</b>. Note that you will get paid only if you complete both modules.</p>
