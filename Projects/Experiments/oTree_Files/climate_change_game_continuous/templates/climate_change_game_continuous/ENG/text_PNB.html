				<p>We now ask you to express your opinion about how many tokens people should contribute to the collective pot in the decision task you just responded to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are assigned to a group with <b>{{other_players_per_group}} other participants</b></li>
    <li>You each receive <b>{{Constants.endowment}} tokens</b></li>
    <li>There is a  <b>{{dis_prob_percentage|floatformat:"0"}}</b> % chance that a disaster occurs</li>
    <li>Any point contributed reduces the impact of that disaster by <b>{{d_impact_percentage|floatformat:"0"}} %</b></li>
</ul>

				<p>In your opinion, how many tokens <b>should every participant contribute</b> to the collective pot?</p><br>
				<p><i>Please decide how many tokens each participant should contribute to the collective pot. It can be any number from 0 to 10. The remainder (if any) they would keep for themselves. You can use the results calculator and disaster simulator below. Once you are satisfied with your decision you can click <b>Next</b> to save your answer and proceed with the next question.</i></p>
